# Just like its name.
## Description
**I just keep repeating something when I need guides, I have to be in the Information Ocean and look up what I need. It's time to collect available solutions and easy to find solution when I need.**

I most use Rocky(The brother of CentOSðŸ¤£), so I can only write solution for it(Most of time, it's also available for Fedora). ***So you can join in the project and add solutions for other systems.***

I am still a student. Syntax and Solution of it may be terrible, ***Issues and PRs are Welcome!***
### ***Let's make the project bigger and bigger!***
### ***Let people no longer resist terrible guide articles on the Internet!***
